To generate xml wallpaper slideshow file, simply run ubuWallGen.py from the directory where your pictures are stored.

Optionally, you can add ubuWallGen to your path so you don't have to enter the full filepath each time.

If your wallpaper to switch every 5 minutes, simply run "./ubuWallGen.py 300" from the directory where your images are stored.
